* Basic Matlab application with a Parameter numeric edit field and an Estimate button.
* The Estimate button functionality includes opening a dialog box

#### Dialog App Information: ####
* The dialog box, triggered by the Estimate button, features a Coefficient numeric edit field and a Calculate button.
* Upon entering a positive value into the Coefficient numeric edit field and clicking the Calculate button, the calculated output is determined as [Coefficient value] * 2.
